# CartPole
In this project, we apply Deep Reinforcement Learning on game system (Cartpole), particularly using deep Q Learning algorithm to
evaluate its performance on this simple game, using the playing environment (OpenAI/gym) where we hope to solve this game, which
is that the agent will get an average of 195 points in 100 games, This is done using new techniques such as saving experiments
(which was proposed for learning  robots by Reinforcement Learning using neural networks in 1993) and training on part of them, 
which will confirm the effectiveness of the applied algorithm, all these techniques make the DQN algorithm achieves stable training 
in addition to increasing the speed of agent learning.
